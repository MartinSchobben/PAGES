@book{Zuur2008,
abstract = {From the perspective of political science, the first question that arises when one looks at the concept of “smartness” is whether it has a political dimension. This chapter intends to answer this question in a positive sense and helps to analyze forms and contents of such political dimension in Western countries. The main thesis is that an “implicit smart politics” exists. This type of politics is often not identifiable as such, not subjected to a real process of political institutionalization, and strongly diffused among the various social actors. Moreover, we affirm that the ‘implicit' character of the smart politics is intertwined with the great changes of modern politics caused by the processes of globalization and by the transformations of the role and meaning of the modern state. Thereafter, this chapter discusses the central risks of the implicit smart politics, whose lack of institutionalization in genuinely democratic political forums may favor the excessive power of economic-financial and technological actors. In the final analysis, we argue for an overall political vision and a long-term political project, which guarantees the recognition and limitability of power and defines the forms of political and democratic participation.},
