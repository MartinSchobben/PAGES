## R project

- All files kept at one place
- Files rooted relative to the project

Linux: `~/Documents/work/my_project`     
Windows: `C:\Documents\work\myproject`




## Data Management

- Keep raw data outside of R project

```{r out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics("DM.png")
```

- Make data files `read-only`
- Keep back-ups of the data directory: [UU surf drive](https://www.uu.nl/en/news/save-and-share-files-securely-with-surfdrive) 


## Version control

Experienced users will use version control, such as Git and Github, to keep track of the changes in their scripts over time. Rstudio project also integrate these options.
