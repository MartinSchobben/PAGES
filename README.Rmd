# PAGES

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package PAGES was designed as supportive material for a webinar designed for the [PAGES Early-Career Network (ECN)](http://pastglobalchanges.org/ecn/intro). The goal is to give some useful pointers to explore geological data, in particular stratigraphic occurrences, and uses RStudio and packages from the [tidyverse universe](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).


```{r pkgs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# following code for loading and writing the bibtex references for the used pkgs
pkgs <- c("dplyr", "tidyr", "tibble", "stringr", "readr", "magrittr",
          "ggplot2", "purrr", "devtools", 
          "roxygen2", "knitr", "rmarkdown",
          "marelac", "datasauRus", "thematic")    
# load
invisible(mapply(library, pkgs, character.only = TRUE))
# Get the R reference
rref <- citation()
# Create ref key
rref$key <- "rversion"
hadley <- bibentry(
  key = "Wickham2015",
  bibtype = "Book",
  title = "R packages: organize, test, document, and share your code",
  author =  person("Hadley","Wickham"),
  year = "2015",
  publisher = " O'Reilly Media, Inc.",
  url = "https://r-pkgs.org/"
  )
knitr::write_bib(pkgs, "vignettes/packages.bib", prefix = "")
pkgs <- bibtex::read.bib("vignettes/packages.bib")
bibtex::write.bib(
  purrr::reduce(list(rref, hadley, pkgs), append), 
  file = "vignettes/packages.bib"
  )
# # copy vignettes
# fs::file_copy(
#   fs::path("PAGES", ext = "bib"), 
#   fs::path("vignettes/PAGES", ext = "bib"), 
#   overwrite = TRUE
#   )
# fs::file_copy(
#   fs::path("packages", ext = "bib"), 
#   fs::path("vignettes/packages", ext = "bib"), 
#   overwrite = TRUE

fs::file_copy(
  fs::path("vignettes/PAGES", ext = "bib"),

  overwrite = TRUE

fs::file_copy(

## R for Data Science (R4DS) 

This class is modelled after Hadley Wickham's and Garrett Grolemund's R4DS. However, I have augmented the examples with cases from geology.

```{r cover, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Book cover [@Wickham2016]", out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/figures/cover.png")
```


## Credits

The construction of the R [@rversion] package *PAGES* and associated documentation was aided by the packages; *devtools* [@devtools], *roxygen2* [@roxygen2], *knitr* [@knitr; @knitr2014 ; @knitr2015], *rmarkdown* [@rmarkdown; @rmarkdown2018; @rmarkdown2020] and the superb guidance in the book: *R packages: organize, test, document, and share your code*, by @Wickham2015. In addition, this package relies on a set of external packages from the tidyverse universe, including: *dplyr* [@dplyr], *tidyr* [@tidyr], *tibble* [@tibble], *stringr* [@stringr], *readr* [@readr], *magrittr* [@magrittr], and *readr* [@readr]. Plots are made with *ggplot2* [@ggplot2; @ggplot22016] and *thematic* [@thematic] is used for a consistent design in the presentation.


## Installation

You can install the released version of PAGES from [github](https://github.io) with:

``` r
# Install PAGES from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartinSchobben/PAGES", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

Load PAGES with `library`.

```{r}
library(PAGES)
``` 

## Data sources 

The study on the Triassic--Jurassic (~201 million years before present) boundary section of Bonenburg (Germany) and Kuhjoch (Austria) by @Schobben2019 is used as the example material for this course. Lazy load datasets constitute:

-`kuhjoch` - Kuchjoch is a palynological dataset where the counts have summed for spores, pollen, aquatic and terrestrial elements.    
-`bonenburg` - Bonenburg is a geochemical dataset containing: elemental analyser total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN), XRF element data; Aluminium (Al), Potassium (K) and sodium (Na), as well as the carbon isotope composition of TOC (del13Ctoc).   

Raw datasets (`kuhjoch_raw.csv` and `bonenburg_raw.csv`) can be easily accessed with the `PAGES_example()` function and a call to the `readr` function `read_csv()`.

``` r 
readr::read_csv(PAGES_example("kuhjoch_raw.csv"))
```

## Render presentation slides


To render the presentation slides:

``` r 
render_slides()
```

## Exercizes

Details regarding the exercizes and live programming during the webinar can be found under the package vignettes (called with `vignette()`).

- RStudio projects: `vignette("project", package = "PAGES")`
- Exploratory data analysis: `vignette("explore", package = "PAGES")`
- Patterns and models: `vignette("model", package = "PAGES")`
- Load, tidy and transform data: `vignette("wrangle", package = "PAGES")`

## Tidy format

The lazy load datasets are provided in a tidy format. Look-up directory `data-raw` for details on the data processing.

```{r tidy}
head(bonenburg)
```

Besides wide format data the similarly named datasets with the suffix `_long` are used to generate, for example, multi-proxy stratigraphic plost for initial data exploraiton.

```{r strat, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
ggplot(data = bonenburg_long) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = value, y = Height)) +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(measurement), scales = "free_x") +
  theme_classic()
```
